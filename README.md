# sign-up-form

The goal of this project was to replicate the sign-up form from the provided design file using HTML and CSS.

Since I feel comfortable with Flexbox I thought I would finish this project in a couple of hours but I spent the whole day instead.
My main problem (where I spent majority of my time) was using the unordered list to organize labels and inputs instead of divs, I never used that technique before (it was suggested on MDN) and it made splitting the inputs in two columns much harder for me, but it was a good learning experience.

Some of the things I learned:

- Opacity applies to the element including its contents - at first I didn't understand why is the text next to my logo also transparent until I did some research how opacity works, the solution was to set opacity on the background-color of the element, not on the element itself.
- You can add multiple box-shadows to an element.
- Better understanding of git branching.

Mistakes I've made/things to improve:

- I didn't pay enough attention when I was writing my initial HTML structure so I had to rethink and add some elements later.
- Should've used git branching earlier.
- Write better class names.
